        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Penguins (order Sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family
          Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic flightless birds.
          They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one
          species, the Galápagos penguin, found north of the Equator. Highly
          adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and
          white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill,
          fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while
          swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land
          and the other half in the sea.

          Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern
          Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as
          Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south.
          Several species are found in the temperate zone, but one species, the
          Galápagos penguin, lives near the Equator.
