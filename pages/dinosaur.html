        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade
          Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between
          243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing
          of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They
          became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
          Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their
          dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
          The fossil record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs,
          having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch,
          and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene
          extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can
          therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and the extinct
          non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

          Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological
          and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,700 living species, are
          among the most diverse group of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence,
          paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than
          1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are
          represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and
          fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before
          birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community
          believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most
          research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that
          dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous
          adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others
          carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying; and
          that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian
          and non-avian.
