        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest
          living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is
          traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
          with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant
          giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the
          mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements
          of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known
          from fossils.

          The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
          long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat
          patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its
          closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from
          Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the
          west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and
          woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody
          plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most
          other herbivores cannot reach.
