        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three species are
          currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
          elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving
          family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the
          mastodons. The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct
          groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African
          elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants
          have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of
          all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large
          ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is
          used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping
          objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both
          as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear
          flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in
          communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.

          Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and
          Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including
          savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and
          they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be
          keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants
          have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come
          together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups,
          which can consist of one female with her calves or several related
          females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are
          led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.
